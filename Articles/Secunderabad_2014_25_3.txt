HYDERABAD: After a seven-year wait, the Telugu Talli flyover, the city''s longest flyover (stretching from the old entrance of the Secretariat to Lower Tank Bund) was thrown open to traffic on Saturday. The flyover had to face several hurdles, including the controversial move to shift the Ambedkar statue, slip roads, etc. Inaugurating the flyover, municipal administration minister Koneru Ranga Rao said the flyover would serve as an alternative road to the Tank Bund road and become a link to Ashok Nagar and Indira Nagar towards Secunderabad. Commuters from Liberty need not have to take a U-turn to go to the Secretariat and this would help in traffic decongestion in the entire area, he said.
